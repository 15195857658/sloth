Welcome to the label tool documentation!
========================================

This is the documentation of the label tool.  The label tool's purpose is to
provide a versatile tool for various labeling tasks in the context of computer
vision research.  Since there are so many different label formats and
requirements out there, we concluded that is virtually impossible to build *the
one* label tool sufficient to handle all labeling tasks.  Therefore, this
project can be seen rather as a framework and set of standard components to
quickly configure a label tool specificly tailored to ones needs.

In this documentation we will go over some of the key concepts of the label tool,
how to configure the label tool using the standard components provided in the package,
and finally how to go further and write specific visualization items and label format
loaders to deal with specific labeling needs.
